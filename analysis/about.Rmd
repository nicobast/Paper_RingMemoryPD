Elaborated reanalysis of [Ring et. al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2251) with investigation of encoding and retreival pupillary responses and their effect on performance in per-trial linear mixed models.

The paradigm includes stimuli (words, Non-words, objects, shapes; 10 items each) that learned in an encoding phase. In a retrieval phase, these stimuli are presented again (old) with stimuli not previoulsy shown (new). participants have to decide whether stimuli are OLD or NEW. Pupillometry is continouly tracked throughout.

comments on variables

- TrialId (20 levels --> 20 for every word level)
- word (4 levels --> should be regarded as TYPE: 1: word, 2: nonword, 3: picture, 4: shape
- shape (40 level --> should be regarded as ITEM)
